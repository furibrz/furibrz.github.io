                    A VISUAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF OVERCONSUMPTION, LIVING TERMINALLY ONLINE.
                    A MINDSTATE WHERE SHORT FORMAT VIDEOS BECOME THE CONTEMPORARY MYTHS, SHAPING HOW WE THINK, PERCEIVE AND ANALYZE REALITY.
                    DIVING DOWN RABBITHOLES OF NARRATIVES THAT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, FRACTURED STORIES INTERRUPTED BY PET VIDEOS AND ADS. LIVING UNDER THE RULE OF ALGORYTHMS AND BOT-ENFORCED COMMUNITY GUIDELINES, ALL DESIGNED TO GATHER DATA TO SELL MORE PRODUCT.
                    THE TOOL TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER ULTIMATELY ALIENATES PEOPLE, CAPTURING THEM IN A BUBBLE OF CUSTOM SELECTED CONTENT.</h3>
                <p class="text"><br>This multichannel video manipulation tool is used to explore the practice of meme culture production known as <i>shitposting</i>, where bursts of poor quality content are released to overload the algorithm. I want to contribute to the collapse between high and low culture. Presenting tiktoks in a gallery space might seem cringe, another meme culture term meaning a brazen naivete or an unfamiliarity with the protocols of a particular community. <b>Could TikToks be considered art? </b>Accepting a reality where short format content perverts the collective psyche is an uncomfortable, yet liberating feeling. The work intends to highlight the influence that the short video format has over our attention span. As a form of embrace of the decay it causes, I was hoping to motivate the viewer to let the mind-numbing content wash over, to allow the question of what comes after? referring to how we can adapt to the new dominating medium of culture. The underlying question of the seemingly naively placed tiktoks is itself a pretext to delve deeper into the phenomena arising with the breakneck speed with which we consume media, constantly accelerating. </p>

                <p class="text">Personally I do not enjoy the pressure of having generative or interactive aspects in digital works. Often the message communicated by the piece could stand on its own without a digital aspect, or even at times becomes drowned out by the noise of technical features. This is why I opted to build a tool that exists for a precise, specific purpose without a user friendly interface or redundant options. It allows me to carve out a streamlined process, which becomes the artwork itself, in the place of a singular object. The techinique is heavily inspired by sampling, a muscial instrument prevalent in electronic and rap music.

                <p class="text">This piece was displayed in two different modes: the aforementioned kiosk, as well as a live performance. To accomodate the latter option, I managed to build functionality of over 10 videos being mixed live. To fully utilize the space given, Resolume was used to multiply the video feed with modified saturation and hue, stockpiling the disorientation meant to be communicated. Continue on down the page to see more of the videos put on display and images of the installation itself. </p>

                <p class="text">Despite the seeming decontextualisation of the videos, taking them outside of their regular home of the phone screen, the piece instead points toward hyperreferentiality, the interconnected nature of all things on the Internet. What I mean by this is that many people recognised the characters or situations presented in the tiktok. I feel like it is not only rewarding for me as the artist, but also the viewer, feeling like they are ‘in on the joke.’ To put a concrete example behind this, I remember one person recognising the rapper Kevin Gates who is known for exaggerating his stories and comical answers to interview questions. </p>

                <p class="text">By alluding to the form of the monolith introduced in the Stanley Kubrick directed 2001: a Space Odyssey, combined with an information kiosk of corrupted internet media, I hope to stress how meaningful these contemporary changes to the mind are, altering the dopamine release system permanently, evolving humans through its own cultural product, constantly optimized for maximum profit. The monolith of 2001 is the physical manifestation of cultural progress, a grand monument to the mystery of new knowledge, leading humanity down the labyrinth of progress.
                    The physical aspect of the presentation has been critical in order to communicate the presence of this phenomenon as something unavoidable, very much in-your-face. To present the installation, I chose an inconspicuous space that is often overlooked, left empty or picked out of necessity rather than as a preconceived idea. Combination of monolith and information kiosk forms allude to a wayfinder that guides through an area. I wanted to subvert the viewer’s expectation though, providing confusion instead. This metaphor also probes the assumption of the validity of information available on the Internet. Does it even matter if what we look at is ‘true’? I suggest that what we consume does not take its value from being anchored in reality. The essence are the stories, the communication of modes of thinking that the audience then suits to their needs, becoming contemporary mythologies, breeding micro-niche communities centered around aesthetic criteria (‘-core’ pages)
